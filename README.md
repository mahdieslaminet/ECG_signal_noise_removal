ECG signal noise removal
Sudden cardiac deaths are more than 80% caused by arrhythmias, the prevalence of which is increasing. In the process of purchasing wearable devices for recording ECG, the signals are usually contaminated with noise such as baseline drift, muscle artifact, and electrode movement. Therefore, the effective removal of noises plays a fundamental role in the accurate detection of arrhythmias. However, traditional filter methods usually focus on only one or two types of noise, and more diverse filter algorithms are needed to deal with different noises, which do not have sufficient generalization ability.
